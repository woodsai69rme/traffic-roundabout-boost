# Roundabout WebTraffic - Authentication Flow

## Overview

This document outlines the authentication flow for the Roundabout WebTraffic platform, detailing the user journey from initial signup through to session management and security features.

## Authentication Architecture

The authentication system for Roundabout WebTraffic is built using Supabase Auth, providing secure, JWT-based authentication with multiple provider options. The system is designed to maintain a seamless user experience while ensuring robust security.

### Key Components

1. **AuthProvider**: A React context provider that wraps the application and provides authentication state and functions to all components.
2. **useAuth Hook**: A custom React hook that exposes authentication functionality to components.
3. **Protected Routes**: Route guards that prevent unauthenticated users from accessing protected content.
4. **Login/Register Pages**: User interfaces for authentication flows.

## User Flows

### Registration Flow

1. **User Initiates Sign Up**:
   - User navigates to the registration page
   - Enters email, password, and optional profile information (name, username)
   - Submits the registration form

2. **Account Creation**:
   - Form data is validated client-side
   - Registration request is sent to Supabase Auth
   - User metadata (name, username) is stored with the account

3. **Email Verification** (when enabled):
   - Verification email is sent to the user
   - User clicks the verification link
   - Email is confirmed in the system

4. **Profile Completion**:
   - User is prompted to complete their profile
   - Additional information is collected and stored
   - User is redirected to the dashboard

### Login Flow

1. **User Initiates Login**:
   - User navigates to the login page
   - Enters email and password
   - Submits the login form

2. **Authentication Process**:
   - Credentials are validated against Supabase Auth
   - JWT tokens are generated and stored
   - User session is established

3. **Post-Login Actions**:
   - User state is updated throughout the application
   - User is redirected to their dashboard or intended destination
   - Session information is persisted for future visits

### Session Management

1. **Session Persistence**:
   - JWT tokens stored in local storage
   - Automatic session restoration on page reload
   - Token refresh mechanism for extended sessions

2. **Session Monitoring**:
   - Auth state change listeners detect login/logout events
   - UI updates in response to auth state changes
   - Expired sessions trigger reauthentication flows

### Logout Flow

1. **User Initiates Logout**:
   - User clicks logout button in the navigation menu
   - Confirmation dialog (optional for sensitive operations)
   - Logout function is triggered

2. **Session Termination**:
   - JWT tokens are removed from storage
   - Supabase session is terminated
   - User state is reset to unauthenticated
   - User is redirected to the home page or login screen

## Security Features

### Password Policies

- Minimum 8 characters
- Complexity requirements (mix of letters, numbers, special characters)
- Password strength indicator during registration
- Secure password reset flow

### Authentication Safeguards

- Rate limiting for login attempts
- Bruteforce protection
- IP-based anomaly detection
- Device fingerprinting for suspicious activity monitoring

### Data Protection

- Row Level Security in Supabase for data access control
- JWT validation for API requests
- HTTPS-only communication
- Secure cookie handling

## Social Authentication

The platform also supports authentication through popular social media providers:

1. **Available Providers**:
   - Google
   - Facebook
   - Twitter
   - Apple

2. **Provider Flow**:
   - User selects social provider
   - OAuth flow initiates with the selected provider
   - User authenticates with the provider
   - Provider returns authentication token
   - Account linking if email already exists in system

## Password Recovery

1. **Initiation**:
   - User clicks "Forgot Password" on login screen
   - Enters their email address
   - Submits recovery request

2. **Recovery Process**:
   - Reset link is sent to user's email
   - Link contains secure, time-limited token
   - User clicks the link and is directed to password reset form

3. **Password Reset**:
   - User enters and confirms new password
   - Password is updated in the system
   - User is redirected to login with new credentials

## Multi-Factor Authentication (Future Enhancement)

1. **Setup Process**:
   - User enables MFA in account settings
   - Configures preferred MFA method (authenticator app, SMS)
   - Verifies MFA setup with test code

2. **Authentication Flow with MFA**:
   - User completes primary authentication (password)
   - MFA challenge is presented
   - User provides second factor (code)
   - Full authentication granted upon verification

## Implementation Details

The authentication system is implemented using:

- Supabase Auth for backend authentication services
- React Context API for state management
- React Router for protected routes
- Shadcn/UI components for authentication interfaces

### Code Structure

- `src/hooks/use-auth.tsx`: The main authentication hook and context provider
- `src/components/AuthNav.tsx`: Authentication-aware navigation component
- `src/pages/Login.tsx` & `src/pages/Register.tsx`: Authentication pages
- `App.tsx`: Protected route implementation

## Conclusion

The authentication system provides a secure, seamless experience for users while protecting sensitive data and functionality. The implementation follows modern security best practices and provides flexibility for future enhancements.
