- ✅ Secure credential storage design
- ✅ Proper session management
- ✅ Input validation and sanitization

## 📦 Current Feature Status

### ✅ Fully Working
- User authentication (signup/login/logout)
- Dashboard navigation
- Responsive UI components
- Basic platform connection interface
- Content scheduler UI
- Analytics dashboard UI
- Documentation system

### ⚠️ Partially Implemented
- Social media API integrations (UI ready, needs credentials)
- AI content generation (UI ready, needs OpenAI key)
- Real-time analytics (mock data in place)
- Multi-platform posting (scheduler ready, needs API implementation)

### ❌ Known Issues
- Some social media APIs require approval process
- OpenAI integration needs API key configuration
- Real platform connections need individual OAuth setup

### ⛔ Missing Features
- Team collaboration features
- Advanced analytics
- White-label solutions
- Mobile app version
- Advanced automation workflows

## 🔧 Technical Decisions Made

### Architecture Choices
- **Frontend**: React 18+ with TypeScript for type safety
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with shadcn/ui for consistent design
- **State Management**: TanStack Query for server state, React Context for global UI state
- **Backend**: Supabase for PostgreSQL, Auth, and Edge Functions
- **Build Tool**: Vite for fast development and building
- **Testing**: Vitest for unit tests (framework ready)

### Database Design
- User profiles with proper foreign key relationships
- Platform connections with encrypted credential storage
- Content scheduling with status tracking
- Analytics data with time-series structure
- Audit logging for security and debugging

### Security Implementation
- Row Level Security (RLS) on all user data
- JWT-based authentication with Supabase
- Encrypted storage for sensitive API credentials
- CORS and rate limiting considerations
- Input validation on all forms

## 📊 Code Quality Metrics
