## Detailed Issue Analysis

### Critical Issues

No critical issues were identified in the testing process.

### Major Issues

#### MAJ-001: Platform Reconnection Failure

**Description**: When a platform API token expires, the automatic reconnection process fails silently, requiring manual intervention.

**Impact**: Users may experience failed posting without clear error messages.

**Root Cause**: Improper error handling in the reconnection workflow.

**Resolution**: Implemented proactive token expiration detection and improved error messaging. Added automatic notification to users when reconnection is required.

**Status**: Resolved in version 1.4.2

#### MAJ-002: Content Calendar Performance Degradation

**Description**: Performance issues in the calendar view when displaying more than 100 scheduled posts across multiple platforms.

**Impact**: Slow loading and interaction for power users with extensive content schedules.

**Root Cause**: Inefficient rendering and data fetching strategy for the calendar component.

**Resolution**: Implemented virtualized rendering for calendar items, optimized data loading with pagination, and added caching for frequently accessed data.

**Status**: Resolved in version 1.4.3

#### MAJ-003: Analytics Data Inconsistency

**Description**: Some users reported discrepancies between platform-provided analytics and data displayed in Roundabout.

**Impact**: Reduced trust in reporting capabilities for data-driven users.

**Root Cause**: Time zone handling issues and inconsistent data refresh cycles.

**Resolution**: Standardized time zone handling, implemented clear last-updated timestamps, and added data reconciliation processes.

**Status**: Resolved in version 1.4.2

### Notable Minor Issues
