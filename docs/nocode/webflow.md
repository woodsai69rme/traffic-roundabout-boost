## Advanced Integration

### Custom Code Integration
For advanced functionality, you can use custom code in Webflow:

```javascript
// Example: Fetch and display latest performance data
document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', async () => {
  const apiKey = 'YOUR_ROUNDABOUT_API_KEY';
  const response = await fetch('https://api.roundabout.io/v1/performance/summary', {
    headers: {
      'Authorization': `Bearer ${apiKey}`,
      'Content-Type': 'application/json'
    }
  });
  
  const data = await response.json();
  
  // Update elements on your page
  document.getElementById('total-engagement').textContent = data.totalEngagement;
  document.getElementById('follower-growth').textContent = `${data.followerGrowth}%`;
  
  // Create chart using data
  createPerformanceChart(data.platformMetrics);
});
```

### Webhook Integration
Set up webhooks to trigger actions when certain events occur:

1. In Roundabout, configure webhook endpoints:
   - Go to Settings > Integrations > Webhooks
   - Add a new webhook pointing to your Webflow site
   - Select triggering events (new post, milestone reached, etc.)

2. In Webflow, create a custom endpoint using Memberships or custom code integration to receive and process webhook data

## Troubleshooting
