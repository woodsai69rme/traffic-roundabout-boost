## Platform Connections

### Why am I having trouble connecting my social media accounts?

Connection issues can occur for several reasons:

1. **Permission Issues**: You may not have sufficient permissions on the social media account
2. **Authentication Errors**: Your social login credentials may be incorrect
3. **API Limitations**: The platform's API may have temporary restrictions
4. **Token Expiration**: Your previous authentication may have expired

Try disconnecting and reconnecting the account, or check our platform-specific troubleshooting guides.

### Why do I need to reconnect my accounts periodically?

Social media platforms have security measures that require periodic re-authentication. This is for your protection and is standard practice for all social media management tools. Roundabout will notify you when reconnection is needed.

### What permissions does Roundabout request from my social accounts?

Roundabout requests only the minimum necessary permissions to perform the functions you use:

- Read access to view your profile and content
- Publish access to post content on your behalf
- Analytics access to retrieve performance metrics
- Comment/reply access to engage with your audience

We never request permissions to access your private messages or to delete your content unless specifically required for a feature you use.

### Can I connect multiple accounts from the same platform?

Yes, you can connect multiple accounts from the same platform (e.g., several Facebook pages or multiple Twitter accounts). The number of accounts you can connect depends on your subscription plan.

## Content Management

### What's the difference between scheduling and queuing posts?

- **Scheduling**: Setting a specific date and time for a post to be published
- **Queuing**: Adding posts to predefined time slots (e.g., "post daily at 9am") without specifying the exact publication date for each post

Both methods help maintain a consistent posting schedule, but queuing is more flexible for batch content creation.

### Can I edit a post after it's been scheduled?

Yes, you can edit any scheduled post before its publication time. Simply:
1. Go to Content Planner
2. Find the scheduled post
3. Click "Edit"
4. Make your changes
5. Click "Update Schedule"

Once a post has been published, editing options depend on the social media platform's native capabilities.

### How far in advance can I schedule posts?

There's no strict limit on how far in advance you can schedule posts with Roundabout. However, some platforms have their own limitations:

- Facebook: Up to 6 months in advance
- Twitter: Up to 18 months in advance
- Instagram: Up to 75 days in advance

Our system will notify you if you attempt to schedule beyond a platform's supported timeframe.

### Does Roundabout support posting videos?

Yes, Roundabout supports video uploads for platforms that allow video content. Maximum file sizes vary by platform, but our system supports videos up to 1GB. We also provide video trimming, thumbnail selection, and caption tools for video content.

## AI Content Generator

### How does the AI Content Generator work?

The AI Content Generator uses advanced language models trained on successful social media content. It considers:

1. Your input topic or keywords
2. Your specified tone and style
3. Best practices for each platform
4. Your brand voice (if you've trained it)

The AI then generates platform-optimized content suggestions that you can use as-is or customize further.

### Will AI-generated content sound like me/my brand?

The AI Content Generator has two modes:

1. **Standard Mode**: Creates content in a generic professional style
2. **Brand Voice Mode**: Creates content that matches your brand's unique style

To use Brand Voice Mode effectively, you should:
- Provide examples of your existing content
- Rate generated content to give feedback
- Update your brand guidelines in the AI settings

The more you use and provide feedback to the system, the better it will align with your brand voice.

### Is there a limit to how many AI generations I can request?

Yes, there are monthly generation limits based on your subscription plan:

- Basic: 50 generations per month
- Professional: 200 generations per month
- Business: 500 generations per month
- Enterprise: Custom limits

One "generation" typically produces 3-5 content variations for you to choose from.

### Can the AI create images as well as text?

Currently, the AI Content Generator focuses on text content. However, our roadmap includes AI image generation capabilities scheduled for release later this year. In the meantime, we offer integration with popular AI image generation tools.

## Analytics and Reporting

### What metrics does Roundabout track?

Roundabout tracks a comprehensive set of metrics, including:

- Engagement (likes, comments, shares, saves)
- Reach and impressions
- Follower growth and demographics
- Click-through rates
- Content performance by type
- Posting time effectiveness
- Hashtag performance
- Conversion tracking (with website integration)

The specific metrics available depend on what each social platform's API provides.

### Can I export analytics reports?

Yes, you can export analytics reports in several formats:

- PDF (visual reports with charts and analysis)
- CSV (raw data for further processing)
- Excel (formatted data with calculations)
- PNG/JPG (individual charts and graphs)

Business and Enterprise plans also support automated report delivery via email and custom branded reporting.

### How far back does historical data go?

Roundabout begins collecting data from the moment you connect your social accounts. For historical data:

- Basic plan: 30 days of history
- Professional plan: 90 days of history
- Business plan: 12 months of history
- Enterprise plan: Custom data retention

Some platforms have their own limitations on historical data availability through their APIs.

### How accurate are the analytics?

Our analytics are sourced directly from each platform's official API, ensuring accuracy equivalent to the platform's native analytics. There might be slight discrepancies due to:

- Time zone differences
- Caching and data refresh rates
- API limitations from certain platforms

We update analytics data at least once every 24 hours, with more frequent updates available on higher-tier plans.

## Team Collaboration

### How many team members can I add?

The number of team members you can add depends on your subscription plan:

- Basic: 1 user (account owner only)
- Professional: Up to 3 team members
- Business: Up to 10 team members
- Enterprise: Unlimited team members

Additional team member seats can be purchased for Professional and Business plans.

- **Creator**: Can create content and submit for approval
- **Analyst**: Read-only access to analytics and reporting
- **Client**: Limited access to specific accounts and reports (Business/Enterprise only)

Custom roles with granular permissions are available on Enterprise plans.

### How does the approval workflow function?

The approval workflow allows content to be reviewed before publication:

1. Creators draft and submit content
2. Managers or Admins receive notification of pending content
3. Reviewers can approve, reject, or request changes
4. Approved content is scheduled or published
5. Creators receive notifications about content status

You can configure multi-level approval workflows on Business and Enterprise plans.

### Can team members access all connected platforms?

By default, team members can access all connected platforms. However, admins can restrict access by:

- Platform (e.g., only Twitter and Instagram)
- Account (e.g., only specific Facebook pages)
- Function (e.g., can view but not publish)

This granular control helps maintain security while enabling effective collaboration.
